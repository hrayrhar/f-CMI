# Useful and frequently used code for training neural networks


## Requirements:
* Basic data science libs: `numpy`, `scipy`, `tqdm`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`.
* We use `Pytorch 1.2.0`, but higher versions may work too.
* Additionally, only for extracting data from tensorboard files one might need tensorflow.
